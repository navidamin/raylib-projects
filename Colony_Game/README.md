### ** Synopsis:**

This is a strategy game named **Colony** about populating an imaginary planet.

The game is a **multi-scale game**, meaning that the **Player** can engage in management at different levels at any time. The **Player** can either focus on managing a small **Unit** of a **Sect** or handle the macroscale between **Colonies** at the **Planet** level.
